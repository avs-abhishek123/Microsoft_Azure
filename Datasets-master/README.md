## API Datasets

This repository contains the data powering uWaterloo API

**Contributing**

You are more than welcome to send pull requests, adding or updating current data
but new datasets will not always make it to the API

It is not required for you to have your data in CSV format. If formats like JSON or XML better represent
the data's hierarchy and relations, use them instead

When sending in new data, try to include the source code used to generate the corresponding data. 
For usability purposes, stick with using scripting languages like Python, PHP or Ruby and try your best
to use least amount of external dependencies/libraries.

**Requesting**

To request data, please see the [OpenData](https://github.com/uWaterloo/OpenData/issues) repository
