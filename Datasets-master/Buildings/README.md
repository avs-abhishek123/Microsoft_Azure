## Buildings

List of official building names and their numbers.

### Schema

```
building_id
building_code
building_name
alternate_building_names
latitude
longitude
```

Where a building might be known by more than one name, either due to a renaming or due to colloquialisms,
include them under the `alternate_building_names` column, and separate multiple names with a pipe character (`|`).
